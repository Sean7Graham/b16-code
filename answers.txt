Q1.1 - Radix Sort

Sort integers based on their most significant binary digit at each iteration, starting 
with the most significant digit. Can then be called recursively on the subsequences
to sort with respect to the next most significant binary digit.

For each digit, the algorithm must perform a sorting of each digit, of complexity
O(n). This must be done for all k binary digits, so the overall complexity is O(kn).


Q2.1 - ArrayInsert

Time complexity: At the worst case, the time complexity is O(n), when the element to
insert is at the beginning of the array. In this case, n copy operations must occur
(replacing A_n with A_n-1, A_n-1 with A_n-2 etc.)
